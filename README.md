## Start
To start the project in localhost
```shell
npm start
```

## Steps : 

1. First, I am creating a ```public``` folder and making a ```index.html``` file. Then, I am adding a div with id="board".
2. Now, I am making a ```src``` folder and adding a React component ```App.js``` file.
3. In the root folder, I am making an ```index.js```, and this serves as the entry point for our Kanban React app.
4. Making a new folder ```components``` inside the ```src``` folder and adding small components for this web app.
5. Fetching data inside ```App.js``` using fetch() and passing them as props.
6. Optimizing ```App.js``` by adding a filter state, storing it in local storage, and passing it as a prop.
7. Now, adding some style to Header and Board.
8. Creating three additional components inside the new folder ```Grouping```, specifically for grouping by status, priority, and users.
9. Making the UI responsive by incorporating media queries.
10. Implementing the sorting feature now.
